==================================

You can use method PackedScene.pack(node) to pack a node and its children into a PackedScene, and then save it with ResourceSaver:

var packed_scene = PackedScene.new()
packed_scene.pack(get_tree().get_current_scene())
ResourceSaver.save("res://my_scene.tscn", packed_scene)

You can then load the packed scene back and instance it as explained in the docs 58:

# Load the PackedScene resource
var packed_scene = load("res://my_scene.tscn")
# Instance the scene
var my_scene = packed_scene.instance()
add_child(my_scene)

Notice you must specify the format in the path extension. In my case I am saving my scene as .tscn. To get a list of all the valid extensions for a resource (PackedScene in this case) use:

# Returns: scn, res, xml, xscn, tscn
ResourceSaver.get_recognized_extensions(packed_scene)

EDIT:

As mentioned by @subhajitroy86 in the comments, you must make sure to set the owner of the child nodes (otherwise the children wonâ€™t be saved):

add_child(new_child)
new_child.set_owner(self)
